# Learn TypeScript

Here, I'm tryna add TypeScript to my developer toolbox ðŸ˜Œ.

## Basic Types

There are the basic types of `number`, `string` and `boolean`. Note: all in lowercase, not the same as `String` in JavaScript.

## Type Inference

TypeScript implicitly deduce type of variables in assigment operations and calcuations so I don't need to specify the type always. You can though it's redundant and not conventional.
For Instance:

```ts
let num1: number = 3; // redundant
const result = 12 + 3; // 15
```
